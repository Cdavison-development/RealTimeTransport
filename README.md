**if you want to use your own XML data in the java program, you will need to convert it from UTF-8-BOM to UTF-8
BusOpenData all seems to be in this format**

create a file named "data" in the root directory 

please unzip data.zip into the data file 

if data is already there, delete it and unzip 


Run using java 17

to test the java code with new python data, replace currently existing files in the data folder

you will need to get your own data from the openbusdata website and parse that

as well as this you will need to insert it using the data insertion functions 

it is best to just use the given database for now. changes will come
